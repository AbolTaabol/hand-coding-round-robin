    <h2>hi :-)</h2>
    <p>
      before we begin...
      <br>
      <br>
      i'm having a moment where i think
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>all computation is metaphor</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      <em>webpages are just files insides of folders on a server</em>
      <br>
      <br>
      and a server is just a computer that holds folders which don't actually exist instead they just tell the computer how to get to the files which in the end are just bits of data encoded in such a way that the computer can store them in memory which is also a metaphor.
      <br>
      <br>
      and so...because all computation is metaphor then <strong>programming is an abstraction</strong>. more so i think it gives us the illusion of control and a feeling of power and i'm wondering...is this why the world wide web, and maybe just computational technology in general, is so messed up? has programming gone so far as to give programmers the illusion that they are actually controlling their computers in such a way that everything they do must be right?
      <br>
      <br>
      i'm interested in <strong>slowing down code</strong> and <em>eroding this notion of control</em>. today we are going to make webpages by carefully typing out html and css on each others computers
      <code>
        <span>&lt;p&gt;</span>ok with that said...<span>&lt;&sol;p&gt;</span>
      </code>

    <h2>what is hand coding</h2>
    <p>
      all webpages are just files and <em>all</em> of them have a file called the <strong>index.html</strong> file. this is <em>always</em> the first file that you see when you go to a website. even the really fancy ones.
      <br>
      <br>
      in this workshop we are going to move away from the bloated websites of 2019 and <strong>learn how to build a webpage slowly, by hand, and with care</strong>. its possible it will look like a webpage from the 90s but it doesn't have to. the funny thing is that the languages, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are very much the same now as they were back then and its more about your content, how you style it and how you leverage the inherent functionality of these three languages.

        introduction to workshop, what is hand coding?
      <br>
      <br>
      0:05 - 0:10
      <br>
        present prompt, create h1 tag with a class name, add css style to h1 tag

      <br>
      0:10 - 0:15
      <br>
        move down one seat, write a short response to the h1 tag inside of a p tag, think about the subtext of the phrase, create p tag with class, add styles
      <br>
      <br>
      0:15 - 0:20
      <br>
        move down one seat, find an image on the internet in response to the p tag, create image tag with class name
      <br>
      <br>
      0:20 - 0:30
      <br>
        move down one seat, add css styles to the image tag, use position absolute, add another image if you have time
      <br>
      <br>
      0:30 - 0:45
      <br>
        spend time adding more styles to the existing elements, look carefully at the code, move things around, introduce javascipt
      <br>
      <br>
      0:45 - 0:50
      <br>
        return to your computer, add another p tag with a short response to the response someone wrote earlier, style this p tag so that it looks different from the other ones
      <br>
      <br>
      0:50 - 0:60
      <br>
        optional sharing, post-workshop notes

    <p>
       open the index.html file that you downloaded before this workshop, it should be on your desktop, open it in a text editor like Atom or Sublime. also make sure that you have a webbrowser open in the background so that other students can easily access it when they are one your computer.
       <br>
       <br>
       lets look at the css at the top of page, line 16
       <br>
       <br>
       <strong>everything underneath the word body is where you'll put the most <em>basic styles</em> for your web page.</strong> these can be things like the backgroud color, or maybe a border. you can use padding to add space between the edge of the browser and the content on your page. get souped ! choose pixel values and colors that you <em>feel</em> good about.
      <br>

      <pre>
        body {<br>
          border: 10px solid blue;<br>
          background-color: yellowgreen;<br>
          color: mediumpurple;<br>
          font-size: 30px;<br>

    <h2>2</h2>
      <p>
         scroll down and place your cursor somewhere inside the body tag, around line 41
         <br>
         <br>
         inside of an h1 tag, please write a sentence or phrase responding to this prompt:
         <br>
         <br>
         <strong>think of a metaphor for the world wide web.</strong> you might write something like: <em>the world wide web is a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs, with extra parmigiano-reggiano</em>
         <br>
         <br>
         make sure to write something that you would want your peers to see
         <br>
         <br>
         and that its something fun for them respond to !
         <br>

        <code>
          <span>&lt;h1&gt;</span>the world wide web is a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs, with extra parmigiano-reggiano<span>&lt;&sol;h1&gt;</span>
        </code>
      </p>
  </section>

  <section class="workshop">
    <h2>3</h2>
    <p>
      scroll down and place your cursor somewhere inside the body tag a few lines below the h1 tag, around line 66
      <br>
      <br>
      inside of an p tag, please write a short response to the phrase inside the h1 tag, think about the subtext of the metaphor:
      <br>
      <br>
      you should also add a class, the name of the class can be anything you want, we will refer to it with css later
     <code>
       <span>&lt;p class="response"&gt;</span>all of the fiber optic cables are like a tangle of spaghetti, unfortunately the meatballs are things like facebook and google and amazon, but the sprinking hand coded websites on top of it all makes it ok.<span>&lt;&sol;p&gt;</span>
